<p>An evening of jazz the way it was meant to be -- improvised</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>By Steve Greenlee/February 17, 2007</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p>The spontaneous creation of music -- jazz, real jazz -- can be magical. Often 
what we hear in the jazz clubs is a tightly scheduled series of solos -- first 
the sax, then the piano, then the bass, then the drums -- bookended by the heads 
of standards that the band plays in order as prescribed by a set list. Yeah, 
there's jazz in there, sure, but you can hardly call that spontaneity.</p>
<b>
<p>Thursday night at the Regattabar was one of those transcendent evenings that 
can make one realize how ordinary, how formulaic, so much of the rest of today's 
music has become.</b> <b>Pianist Marc Copland , bassist Gary Peacock , and drummer 
Bill Stewart created art out of nothing.</b> They arrived without a set list, and 
some of the tunes weren't even songs; they were sketches composed on the spot 
through the art of improvisation. It wasn't clear, either, who was leading the 
group -- the album the trio recently released is under Copland's name, and the 
concert gave Peacock (the best known of the three) top billing, but it seemed 
more likely that <b>these guys don't need a leader. </b>No tunes were announced. 
There was no chatter with the audience. Songs often began with Copland shrugging 
his shoulders toward Peacock, as if to say, &quot;What do you want to play?&quot; Peacock 
returned an &quot;I don't know&quot; look and would say aloud, &quot;Start something.&quot;</p>
<p>They sure did.</p>
<p>Peacock began the concert with a bluesy, facile solo that launched the trio 
into an exploratory take of Sonny Rollins's &quot;Doxy&quot; that had the musicians 
thinking and feeling their way through the tune, Stewart driving the train with 
his propulsive drumming and Copland spiraling further and further from the 
theme. They followed it with a free, unnamed improvisation that sounded like a 
light rain turning into thunder -- brushes on cymbals leading to Copland's thick 
chords and splashing arpeggios. A lovely ballad called &quot;At Night&quot; that centered 
on a gentle, eight-note figure was pretty without being precious, and the 
musicians seemed to surprise themselves by abandoning the softness midway 
through and taking up a funky groove for maybe 32 bars. They ended the first set 
with a churning, volatile version of &quot;Stella by Starlight.&quot; <b>After the set 
Copland told me he had never played the song in that particular key before. Yes, 
that's real jazz for you.</b></p>

<p>NYC, March 2008 (Birdland)</p>
</b></i>
<p>By Budd Kopman, March 29, 2008</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p>Copland is a masterfully subtle player whose strengths lie in understatement, 
harmonic control and coloration, melodic implication and an almost sensuous 
keyboard touch rather than in pyrotechnics.</b> All of these seemingly 
self-effacing musical qualities are balanced, however, by an continuously 
incisive and quick mind combined with a deep and strong will. Self-taught, 
Copland's piano playing shows that he has a direct mental connection the music, 
the physical act of playing the instrument a mere detail. That he is forever 
smiling completes the telling, endearing picture.</p>
<b>
<p><br>
Because Copland is so inventive, standards are actually welcome, as the listener 
becomes engrossed in how a familiar tune is bent, but never broken, particularly 
harmonically</b>. Peacock was a full partner, leading as often as following, and 
taking solos that grew organically out of what had preceded. He is indeed a very 
physical player, playing in a vertical pattern as his fingers fly up and down, 
rather than across, the fingerboard. Able to play freely, but then drop into a 
strong rhythmic role, Peacock is the perfect foil for any pianist who can match 
the bassist's musical reflexes and imagination.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Each piece became a musical adventure, an extended fantasy, with a dramatic 
arc that was built expertly by the trio. Copland practically paints with the 
piano, the sheer lushness of his physical sound, when mixed with his harmonies 
and their piquant dissonances, washing over the audience. </b>For his part, 
Peacock took the music to many unexpected places, and there were many knowing 
smiles during and after each tune.</p>
