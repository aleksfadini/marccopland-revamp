<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jazz at its best is an adventure of the mind and an affair of 
the heart. Those of us who love this music share a bond: we live for those 
musical moments that inspire us by challenging our ears, teaching our minds and 
elevating our spirit.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best of these moments take on an almost magical quality. 
In pursuit of such moments, real fans and dedicated musicians expend so much of 
their time and invest so much of themselves. What is this magic - what are the 
criteria for excellence in jazz? For this magic to continue, it is important for 
the excellence creating it to be recognized and nurtured.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">40 or 50 years ago, something of a consensus on this subject 
existed. The best artists, signed by a handful of record labels, were free to 
record without commercial constraints and their music seemed to break new ground 
with almost each new release. The important bands--Miles, Coltrane, Bill Evans 
among them--found a healthy availability of gigs in which to develop their 
concepts; and because work was steady, the listening public had a chance to hear 
and digest their music and development. This was a great era for jazz. It grew 
in wonderful ways; great innovations were rarely ignored and their inclusion 
made the music vibrant and healthy.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last half-century, a confluence of developments - 
artistic, commercial and technological---has contributed to the evolution of a 
less uniform jazz world. Some of the by-products of this evolution are positive; 
for example, there is available today a Dionysian feast of musical styles 
unimaginable in the jazz of the mid 20th century. But the growth of stylistic 
variety has been accompanied by a lessening of consensus as to what constitutes 
high quality music. Commercial interests often lose sight of important artistic 
developments - or, sometimes while recognizing them, lose faith in the public’s 
ability to do the same. As a result, a lot of great art goes undiscovered; and 
when an art form loses opportunities for growth it is all the poorer for it.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Older jazz classics, which should help point the way, are in 
trouble, too. Many true works of genius--essential parts of the music’s history 
- are unknown to most of today’s public, even to serious music students. Young 
aspiring players hearing these recordings for the first time are often stunned 
by the music’s brilliance and freshness; this should come as no surprise, for 
works of genius don’t go out of style. If this music is properly recognized, the 
acumen of the public will increase, which can only help the music in the long 
run.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Works of genius possess a special feel and sense of 
intuition, as well as a sophisticated usage of harmony, melody, counterpoint, 
rhythm, form and/or structure, taking a step beyond or adding to previous 
musical practice. These works - these solos - are, although improvised, so well 
constructed that removing a few notes or even a single note seriously diminishes 
the impact of the music.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These same criteria ought to apply to today’s music: the 
notes don’t lie. Are the notes hip - are there deeper reasons for their 
presence? Such reasons are audible in the finest music of any genre. Style, 
setting and instrumentation can be crucial musical components, their importance 
to jazz no less than that of orchestration to classical music; but the defining 
characteristic remains not what instrument or instruments played the notes, but 
the merit of the notes themselves.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Originality should not be confused with superficial 
differences. Great music has an organic, conceptual idea and distinguishes 
itself by its content; over-emphasizing extra-musical factors runs the risk of 
missing the point. Innovative playing blazes its trails with new musical usages 
that are responsible for how fresh the music sounds, even in a solo recorded 
years ago. Stylistic context can be crucial, but the wonder is what the musician 
achieves working in any particular milieu. Hungarian folk music, with its 
unusual rhythms and scales, was essential to Bartók’s work --but this folk music 
did not bring about the high level of his compositions; Bartók’s genius did. The 
revolutionary musical tools of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring are not lost when 
performed on two pianos. And Coltrane’s solo on the original release of 
&quot;Impressions&quot; --coming from the supposedly brash improviser of &quot;sheets of 
sound&quot;--reveals itself upon deeper examination to be a masterpiece of melodic 
development, a worthy successor to the work of Louis Armstrong and Lester Young.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To appreciate achievements of this level requires a lot of 
listening, but the rewards are great. Whether we listen to a recorded solo 
capable of being revisited repeatedly, or to a live solo never to be heard 
again, our deep attention to and appreciation of the music will lead to an 
understanding of the notes as the product of a sophisticated musical 
intelligence--of mind and passion working together at the highest level. The 
great solo makes uncommon musical sense not only in its original context, but as 
an architecture of notes that says something far beyond its setting; it opens 
the door to the understanding of a higher meaning.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that human beings can create such work and do so in 
barely a few minutes of instrumental improvisation rather than by long hours of 
trial and error at a desk with pencil and paper, is a wonder. It leaves us no 
choice but to marvel at another of the many ways--and for us, a very special 
way--in which beauty can be created by the human mind and spirit.</p>
